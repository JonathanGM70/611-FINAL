If you are looking for the code to my final BIO 611 project for some reason, you've come to the right place.

The data inputs used for this project are too large to upload here, as they are multiple gigabites large each. Instead, raw files are available in the NCBI SRA for public use. The Mcoln1 -/-  mouse retina and human AMD macula bulk RNA-seq datasets are both available on the NCBI SRA repository from the following project accession IDs respectively: SRP222833 and PRJNA1002601. Alignment of reads is required for DEU analysis.
